21:40:40 You don't currently have JPL planetary ephemerides set up
for use in Find_Orb.  This will result in some loss of accuracy
and speed.  See https://www.projectpluto.com/find_orb.htm#de_eph
for further information.

Hit any key to continue.  Find_Orb will still work,  though it will
be a little slower and less accurate.  You should eventually download
a JPL ephemeris file,  per the instructions at the above link.
